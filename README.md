# PROJECT MODULE 1 - BOOK LIBRARY PROGRAM
Hello! My name is Delabrilliano,
I am currently learning data science and this is my first finished project on my learning journey!

The book library program that i made uses Python as the programming language and although it is intended for book library, it can also be used on other fields just by
tweaking the code for a little bit.

As this is my first project that i finished, please kindly give suggestions and feedback for my program.
Thank you!
