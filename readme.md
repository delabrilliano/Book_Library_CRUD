Hello! This is my first project on my learning journey on becoming a data scientist. This program is a simple database management (CRUD) for Library's book database. However, if you want to use it for other purpose, you can tweak the code a little bit and tailor it as you see fit.

## **Main Menu**

When the program first ran, It will show the program's 5 main menu. Which is:

> 1. Explore and Read the Library Book Database.
> 2. Adding New Book to the Database.
> 3. Update the Existing Book on the Database. 
> 4. Delete Existing Book from the Database.
